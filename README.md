[Matt Studdert](https://dev.to/mattstuddert)Â forÂ [Frontend Mentor](https://dev.to/frontendmentor)

There's nothing quite like building projects to grow as a developer. Tutorials are a brilliant learning tool. But at some point, the training wheels need to come off and you need to start building.

The problem is, as developers, we're often not the best at making things look great ourselves ðŸ˜…

I wouldn't even know where to begin if someone asked me to create something beautiful from scratch! But, if a designer hands me a design I'll more than happily code it up.

If you're in the same boat, we've got some great projects for you at Frontend Mentor. Each one includes mobile & desktop designs, a front-end style guide (for fonts, colors, etc) and a basic brief. The assets are all provided and pre-optimized meaning all you need to focus on is writing the code!

You can use any tools you like while building each project. So if you're wanting to practice things like React, Vue, Sass, Tailwind you get to choose your setup.

So, without further ado let's get started on the first challenge:

## 1) Single price grid component

[![Design preview for the Single Price Grid Component challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FzGw2rbZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3y0bhisv135j7979dk3m.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FzGw2rbZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3y0bhisv135j7979dk3m.jpg)

| Requirements | Difficulty | Type | URL                                                                                                           |

| HTML, CSS    | Newbie     | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/single-price-grid-component-master) |

This challenge is a perfect starting point. Instead of building an entire landing page, your task is to build a single component.

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Learning Outcomes

Although small, this project presents some nice layout challenges. It's a great opportunity to practice Flexbox or CSS Grid. You'll also get the basics of building a responsive component.

## 2) Four card feature section

[![Design preview for the Four card feature section challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cKOH5pjN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6nr064pgbqxp9mxzu1l5.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cKOH5pjN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6nr064pgbqxp9mxzu1l5.jpg)

You'll face an interesting layout test in this project. How would you approach the vertically centered cards?

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Learning Outcomes

This will be another useful challenge to build up your confidence when laying out elements. You'll have to choose the best approach to align the cards and make them re-align down to mobile screen size.

## 3) Huddle landing page with a single introductory section

[![Design preview for the Huddle landing page with a single introductory section challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--32Akh1u---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dnd2mir4y5jrh5fodz0k.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--32Akh1u---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dnd2mir4y5jrh5fodz0k.jpg)

| Requirements | Difficulty | Type | URL                                                                                                   |

| HTML, CSS    | Newbie     | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/huddle-landing-page-master) |

This challenge will build on the other two and take it up a notch. You'll need to think about how best to position and space the elements out on the page.

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states on desktop for all interactive elements

### Learning Outcomes

Think about positioning images and content next to one another. Scaling the content down to mobile without it looking too squashed will be a challenge as well.

## 4) Base Apparel coming soon page

[![Design preview for the Base Apparel coming soon page challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ro5T2UDh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/iv2dvcba7h7jgaun54w0.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ro5T2UDh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/iv2dvcba7h7jgaun54w0.jpg)

| HTML, CSS, JS | Newbie     | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/base-apparel-coming-soon-master) |

You'll get your first sprinkling of JavaScript in this challenge. You'll need to validate the form when it's submitted. Oh, and there's a sneaky layout order swap with the written content and the image from desktop to mobile.

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Learning Outcomes

You'll learn how to do basic form validation on a single field. This project will also take a bit of layout planning, so be sure to take some time, in the beginning, to think it through.

## 5) Intro component with sign-up form

[![Design preview for the Intro component with sign-up form challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--si441IH5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/m6um70gb28iy7p73lvpt.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--si441IH5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/m6um70gb28iy7p73lvpt.jpg)

| HTML, CSS, JS | Newbie     | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/intro-component-with-signup-form-master) |

Now that you've done form validation on a single field, how about doing it on four? Also, don't forget to make sure the inputs are accessible to screen reader users!

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Learning Outcomes

By now you should have a good handle on basic layout. So the main learning outcome here will be how to write reusable JavaScript code to check the validity of the different form fields.

## 6) Pricing component with toggle

[![Design preview for the Pricing component with toggle challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o5R67jWi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uyyuyf611t8elhug4tt0.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o5R67jWi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uyyuyf611t8elhug4tt0.jpg)

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

### Learning Outcomes

If you go for the bonus you'll need to think through your HTML structure carefully. You'll need the perfect markup to be able to make use of pseudo-classes and sibling selectors for the toggle.

## 7) Insure landing page

[![Design preview for the Insure landing page challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bMZsYWrR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/p935ob8ei744sp2bedby.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bMZsYWrR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/p935ob8ei744sp2bedby.jpg)

| HTML, CSS, JS | Junior     | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/insure-landing-page-master) |

There's only a tiny bit of JavaScript for this challenge with the mobile navigation toggle. But it will be the first time that you're building a multi-section landing page on this track.

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Learning Outcomes

Take some time to plan this out before diving into the code. You'll be faced with some interesting tests placing the background patterns.

| ------------- | ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML, CSS, JS | Intermediate | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/manage-landing-page-master) |

This landing page will give your CSS skills a nice test. There are some background patterns that need to be positioned accurately and some little details in the switch from desktop to mobile. There are also a few areas that will require some JS.

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign-up form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Learning Outcomes

Your major takeaways from this challenge will be related to CSS and layout. If you haven't done so by now, you might want to try out a pre-processor, like Sass, to help keep your code maintainable.

## 11) Bookmark landing page

[![Design preview for the Bookmark landing page challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TmKvOVHA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ieork0qcwe5oaw4ao31h.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TmKvOVHA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ieork0qcwe5oaw4ao31h.jpg)

| ------------- | ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML, CSS, JS | Intermediate | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/bookmark-landing-page-master) |

Another landing page challenge to reinforce what you learned in the last challenge. This one includes a couple of trickier elements though. Firstly, the background patterns aren't included as assets in the download, so you need to code them yourself. Secondly, we've got a couple of JS-based components with the feature tabs and FAQs section.

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Learning Outcomes

This challenge will help solidify your knowledge and refine workflow when creating a fairly complex layout. This is another good opportunity to use a pre-processor. You might even want to have a go at using a UI framework, like Tailwind, if you're feeling comfortable with pure CSS/Sass by now.

## 12) Job listings with filtering

[![Design preview for the Job listings with filtering challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jn154_sy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/yruacppjz9p4i10nevab.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jn154_sy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/yruacppjz9p4i10nevab.jpg)

| Requirements  | Difficulty   | Type | URL                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML, CSS, JS | Intermediate | Free | [View Project](https://github.com/JonatanGarbuyo/frontendmentor/tree/main/static-job-listings-master) |

Now that you've got a bit more comfortable with JavaScript, let's practice some filtering. In this challenge, you'll need to filter the job listings by the categories selected. There are two options to choose from for how to approach it:

- **Option 1**: Filter job listings based on the categories using the HTMLÂ `data-`Â attribute. In this option, you'd use the hardcoded content that already exists in theÂ `index.html`Â file.
- **Option 2**: Use the localÂ `data.json`Â file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content. This would be perfect if you're looking to practice a JS library/framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories selected

### Learning Outcomes

You'll learn how to use JavaScript to filter items in the DOM. This is a key skill when building client-side applications, so this challenge will be great practice!

[![Design preview for the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock bonus challenge](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LejfKhib--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/j5h6b8mpx116fo2s94dh.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LejfKhib--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/j5h6b8mpx116fo2s94dh.jpg)

For those of you who don't know about Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, take a look at this:

### Brief

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browserÂ *(optional)*
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computerÂ *(optional)*

### Learning Outcomes

This challenge will give your logic-based problem-solving skills a nice run-out. Try to push yourself to build the bonus game if you can. This is another opportunity to practice using localStorage to maintain the state of the game if the user refreshes their browser.
